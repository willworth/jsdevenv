WRITE GOOD COMMIT MESSAGES
Begin your message with a short summary of
your changes (up to 50 characters as a guideline). Separate it from the following body
by including a blank line. The body of your
message should provide detailed answers to
the following questions:
› What was the motivation for the change?
› How does it differ from the previous
implementation?
Use the imperative, present tense («change»,
not «changed» or «changes») to be consistent
with generated messages from commands
like git merge.
