NOTES!
.editorconfig
put in root of project

create packages.json and then npm install gets all the dependencies


security of node packages?
node security platform
global install is as follows
npm install -g nsp

then to run nsp check
in terminal ctrl c to kill process... if you're gonna reload express or whatevs

for sharing

localtunnel(easiest), ngrok(secure), now(persistent) surge(static only)

localtunnel can take a subdomain eg will.localtunnel.me


=================AUTOMATION==========
grunt was first, file oriented, json.
gulp is fast
npm scripts  fewer dependencies, use tools directly

so scripts are defined in package.json
npm scripts support pre post hooks - so prestart will run before start...
for parallel running of scripts:
 "start": "npm-run-all --parallel security-check open:src",

 use npm start -s (silent) to cut down the noise


 =============bundlers=======
Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections; good programmers divide their programs into modules.

we then bundle them back together to reduce process load etc

webpack allows you to bundle much more than just js
css images fonts html
hot reloading
bundle splitting
